The dataset is the hemagglutinin (HA) genome of seasonal H3N2 Influenza (type A).
<br><br>
You can always click on the top right button "EXPLORE THE DATA YOURSELF", and get back to this narrative easily via the same button.
<br><br>
Now let us go through the panels one by one.

# [The Phylogenetic Tree](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/12y?d=tree&p=full)

The phylogenetic tree is the backbone of the whole nextstrain research.
<br><br>
It is inferred via sequence alignment and Bayesian maximum likelihood (ML) methods.
<br><br>
This means, that the dots are known data points, whereas the internal branches come with a confidence interval. Try hovering a branch or a node!
<br><br>
The coloring is by different clades, the Xs show vaccine strains.

# [The Map](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/12y?d=map&p=full)

Nextstrain's sequences come with metadata, such as the location and date of the sample.
<br><br>
These can be used to populate a map with the data from the phylogenetic tree, but careful:
<br><br>
The map does **not** show the number of cases in a certain area. It shows the _number of sampled genomes_, that is it makes a statement about data availability.

# [Tree and Map interplay](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/12y?animate=2010-05-23,2020-04-13,1,0,15000&d=tree,map&p=grid)

We can also watch the unfolding of pathogen evolution having the tree and the map in sync.
<br><br>
This is particularly useful for getting a quick overview over a transient situation.

# [Diversity in the genome](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2/ha/12y?d=tree,map,entropy&p=grid)

Very useful is the panel showing the diversity of the genome at each amino acid (AA) or nucleotide position (NT).

Sites of low diversity are a sign for a crucial region in the genome (for example a receptor binding domain).

The genome can be zoomed and, by clicking a particular site

This is what it is supposed to look like, it is very close to coloring by clade.
